# Reder

Reder (As in reader) is a free and open source Reddit-style forum for users to share links and images and start discussions.  It is part of the 30-54 project to provide gun-friendly social networking but will be available for anyone to use.

## Design philosophy

The core application and setup documentation must be kept as simple as possible to ensure accessibility for the largest possible audience.  Reder should empower site administrators and subreder moderators to run their communities as they see fit.  They will be trusted with a full range of abilities to moderate and customize their communities.  

## Planned features

* User creation of subreders with ability to be restricted by admins
* Email confirmation and password resets
* Email based two-factor authentication
* Ability for administrators to close registration or require manual activation of new accounts
* Allow admins to add and remove moderators from subreders
* Ability to require 2FA for admins in the config file
* Email domain blacklisting and whitelisting
* Granular access for moderators and administrators
* Empower users to moderate their own use of the site through blocking users and possibly subreders
* Blocked users will not be able to see the posts of users who blocked them
* Granular options for administrator and moderator actions including shadow banning users and quarantining subreders
* Voting controls where moderators can disable downvoting and admins can disable downvoting sitewide or require it
